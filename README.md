# Operating-Systems-Project-2
In this project, I implemented a memory manager in C++, whose features included initializing, tracking,
allocating, and deallocating sections of memory. I integrated the memory manager into a console program
that was provided for me. I maintained a valid listing of memory holes and combined those holes as appropriate.
